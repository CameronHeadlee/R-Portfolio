# React Portfolio

This is my portfolio website. It was created using React.js and React-Bootstrap. You will find several pages on this website from About, My work, Contact, and Resume. Throughout the website you will see accordions and icons. Every accordion contains a section of writing and every icon is a clickable link. There are two ways to navigate from page to page, you have the option to use the top navigation bar to jump to wherever you would like in the site or use a button on the bottom of every page that will send you to the next page in order. Also, there is a form on the Contact page that allows you to send me an email through the website. Feel free to contact me at any point with suggestions on improvement or employment opportunity.
