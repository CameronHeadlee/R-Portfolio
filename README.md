# React Portfolio

This is my portfolio website. It was created using React.js and React-Bootstrap. You will find several pages on this website from About, My work, Contact, and Resume. Throughout the website you will see accordions and icons. Every accordion contains a section of writing and every icon is a clickable link. There are two ways to navigate from page to page, you have the option to use the top navigation bar to jump to wherever you would like in the site or use a button on the bottom of every page that will send you to the next page in order. Also, there is a form on the Contact page that allows you to send me an email through the website. Feel free to contact me at any point with suggestions on improvement or employment opportunity.

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
